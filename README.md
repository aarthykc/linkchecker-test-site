# Netlify Site With Links Example

This is a very simple site with a few links on it. Some of them work, some of them do not! Try creating a [private integration](https://sdk.netlify.com/publish/private-integrations/) on Netlify that can check which links work or not!

## Deploy this site to Netlify

Deploy this site to Netlify to test out your own private integration.
